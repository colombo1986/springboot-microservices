# springboot-microservices

In this course,I learn to build Microservices using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, React, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and REST API (REST Web Services).

Microservices:

A Microservice is a service built around a specific business capability that can be independently deployed. So, to build large enterprise applications we can identify the sub-domains of our main business domain and build each sub-domain as a MicroService using Domain Driven Design (DDD) techniques. But in the end, we need to make all these microservices work together to serve the end user as if it is a single application.

Why Spring boot and Spring cloud are good choices for MicroServices?

Spring Boot is the most popular and widely used Java framework for building Microservices. These days many organizations prefer to deploy their applications in a Cloud environment instead of taking all the headaches of maintaining a data center themselves. But we need to take good care of the various aspects to make our applications Cloud Native. There comes the beauty of Spring Cloud.

Spring Cloud is essentially an implementation of various design patterns to be followed while building Cloud Native applications. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we can simply take advantage of various Spring Cloud modules and focus on our main business problem than worrying about infrastructural concerns.
